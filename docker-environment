docker run -d --name tomcat-container -p 8081:8080 tomcat      #create a container
ip:8081  # to browse your container
    ---# you are now able to see tomcat but status is 404 error, lets fix this issue.
        (this error is due to all contents bydefault went in webapps-dist, so lets copy all content from webapp-dist into webapp.

docker exec -it tomcat-container /bin/bash        #login your container
ls   # check content in your container
cd webapps.dist  # go to this directory and copy all content into webapp
ls
cp -R * ../webapps/  #copied into webapp.

  #now check your tomcat is avaiable on your browser.
